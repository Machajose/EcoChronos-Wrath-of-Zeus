# 📚 EcoChronos Documentation

## 🛠 System Overview
EcoChronos is a mythology-powered environmental game that blends storytelling, science, and real-world action.  
This documentation explains the technical design, architecture, datasets, and workflows.

---

## 🏗 Architecture
**Flow:**  
Game Engine → API → Database → Proof-of-Action Storage → Rewards Engine → (Optional) Blockchain

**Components:**
- **Frontend:** Unity/Godot/React
- **Backend:** Node.js + Express
- **Database:** Firebase/Supabase
- **Storage:** AWS S3 for photo proof
- **On-chain (future):** Polygon / Celo / Base

---

## 🔌 APIs & Endpoints
- `POST /api/upload-proof` → Uploads photo evidence of real-world action  
- `GET /api/rewards` → Fetches XP, badges, and achievements  
- `GET /api/lessons` → Serves micro-learning content  
- `POST /api/verify-action` → Validates proof-of-action submissions  

---

## 🌍 Datasets & References
- UNEP Nature-based Solutions data  
- GBM (Green Belt Movement) datasets  
- Climate/forest GIS layers  
- Plastic pollution statistics (UNEP, WWF)

## 🎮 User Flow
1. Player starts a mission in-game.  
2. Learns a micro-fact via popup.  
3. Completes a real-world action (e.g., tree planting).  
4. Uploads proof (photo/location).  
5. Backend verifies → rewards issued.  
6. Optional on-chain minting for Proof-of-Action.  

---

## ⚙️ Backend Workflows
- **Verification Logic:** Checks photo metadata, location, and partner QR codes.  
- **Reward Calculation:** Assigns XP, badges, or tokens based on action type.  
- **Time Meter Updates:** Adjusts biome health in real-time.
